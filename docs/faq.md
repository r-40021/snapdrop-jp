    Help! I can't install the PWA!
</summary>

if you are using a Chromium-based browser (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.), you can easily install PairDrop PWA on your desktop 
by clicking the install-button in the top-right corner while on [pairdrop.net](https://pairdrop.net).

<img width="400" src="pwa-install.png" alt="Example on how to install a pwa with Edge">

On Firefox, PWAs are installable via [this browser extensions](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/pwas-for-firefox/)

<br>

<b>Self-Hosted Instance?</b>

To be able to install the PWA from a self-hosted instance, the connection needs to be [established through HTTPS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Installable_PWAs).
See [this host your own section](https://github.com/schlagmichdoch/PairDrop/blob/master/docs/host-your-own.md#testing-pwa-related-features) for more information.

    How to save images directly to the gallery on iOS?
</summary>

Apparently, iOS does not allow images shared from a website to be saved to the gallery directly.
It simply does not offer the option for images shared from a website.

iOS Shortcuts to the win:
I created a simple iOS shortcut that takes your photos and saves them to your gallery:

    Are there any Third-Party Apps?
</summary>

Here's a list of some third-party apps compatible with PairDrop:

1. [Snapdrop Android App](https://github.com/fm-sys/snapdrop-android)
2. [Snapdrop for Firefox (Addon)](https://github.com/ueen/SnapdropFirefoxAddon)
3. Feel free to make one :)

    What about the connection? Is it a P2P-connection directly from device to device or is there any third-party-server?
</summary>

It uses a WebRTC peer to peer connection. WebRTC needs a Signaling Server that is only used to establish a connection. The server is not involved in the file transfer.

If devices are on the same network, none of your files are ever sent to any server.

If your devices are paired and behind a NAT, the PairDrop TURN Server is used to route your files and messages. See the [Technical Documentation](technical-documentation.md#encryption-webrtc-stun-and-turn) to learn more about STUN, TURN and WebRTC.

If you host your own instance and want to support devices that do not support WebRTC, you can [start the PairDrop instance with an activated Websocket fallback](https://github.com/schlagmichdoch/PairDrop/blob/master/docs/host-your-own.md#websocket-fallback-for-vpn).

    What about privacy? Will files be saved on third-party-servers?
</summary>

Files are sent directly between peers. PairDrop doesn't even use a database. If you are curious, have a look [at the Server](https://github.com/schlagmichdoch/pairdrop/blob/master/index.js).
WebRTC encrypts the files on transit.

If devices are on the same network, none of your files are ever sent to any server.

If your devices are paired and behind a NAT, the PairDrop TURN Server is used to route your files and messages. See the [Technical Documentation](technical-documentation.md#encryption-webrtc-stun-and-turn) to learn more about STUN, TURN and WebRTC.

    What about security? Are my files encrypted while being sent between the computers?
</summary>

Yes. Your files are sent using WebRTC, which encrypts them on transit. To ensure the connection is secure and there is no MITM, compare the security number shown under the device name on both devices. The security number is different for every connection.

    Transferring many files with paired devices takes too long
</summary>

Naturally, if traffic needs to be routed through the turn server because your devices are behind different NATs, transfer speed decreases.

You can open a hotspot on one of your devices to bridge the connection which omits the need of the TURN server.

- [Library to open a hotspot on Linux](https://github.com/lakinduakash/linux-wifi-hotspot)

You can also use mobile hotspots on phones to do that. 
Then, all data should be sent directly between devices and your data plan should not be charged.

    Why don't you implement feature xyz?
</summary>

Snapdrop and PairDrop are a study in radical simplicity. The user interface is insanely simple. Features are chosen very carefully because complexity grows quadratically since every feature potentially interferes with each other feature. We focus very narrowly on a single use case: instant file transfer. 
We are not trying to optimize for some edge-cases. We are optimizing the user flow of the average users. Don't be sad if we decline your feature request for the sake of simplicity. 

If you want to learn more about simplicity you can read *Insanely Simple: The Obsession that Drives Apple's Success* or *Thinking, Fast and Slow*.
